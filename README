Multihard is a operating system kernel like linux 0.12
Now it can run bash

First you need to edit config.sh, fill the variable.
before compile it, you need to run some script

1. init_make.sh: build make file for auto compile
2. init_rootfs.sh: build root filesystem used for running Multihard, finally get image file rootfs.img
3. init_software.sh: install software(bash, binutils and gcc) on rootfs, need software.img, you need to build it yourself. as for how to port these software to multihard, refer to build/INSTALL_SOFTWARE. this script will copy software file on software.img to rootfs (NOT INCLUDE /USR/SRC and /OPT).

after executing these script, you can test it, use make, then it will compile all source file and copy execute file including kernel to rootfs. then you can run:
bochs: direct running bochs 
make gdebug: debug kernel, you can use gdb to remote debug it, remote debug address is localhost:1234
make qemu: direct running qemu (not debug)
